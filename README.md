# myFlix Client

Client-side application for the myFlix movie app, built using React and the MERN stack.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myflix-client.git
    cd myflix-client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server with Parcel:**

    ```sh
    parcel src/index.html
    ```

## Testing the Project

To test your project, use Parcel to serve the `index.html` file. Make sure to use the actual path to `index.html` relative to the current directory.

```sh
parcel src/index.html

Parcel will start a development server and your project will be accessible at http://localhost:1234 (by default). Any changes you make to the source files will automatically trigger a hot reload.
